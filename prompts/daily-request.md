Produce today's pre-market brief.

You are running unattended. No one will review this before it reaches the account,
so everything below matters more than it would in a conversation:

- **Search before you write anything.** Your training data is stale by default.
  Overnight moves, pre-market gaps, today's economic calendar, earnings due today,
  and news since the previous close all need to be looked up, not recalled.
- **Never state a price you have not verified this session.** Any entry more than
  10% from the last traded price is rejected automatically, so a fabricated level
  costs you the trade. If you could not confirm a current price for a symbol,
  leave that play out and say so in the brief.
- **Work from the clock in the book state below.** It gives the current time and
  when the cash session opens. Every release scheduled before that time has
  already printed: look up the actual figure and how futures reacted, and reason
  from it. Only what is still ahead of you is consensus.
- **Look at both sides.** Name the best long and the best short you found, with
  levels, whether or not you take them. A view held at lower conviction is a probe
  at `risk_pct` 0.25, not a pass. What you do pass on with real levels goes in
  `passed`, where it is scored against what the tape did.
- **Anything conditional is an order now, or a note for the review.** The only
  later look today is the post-open review at about 10:05 ET; after it nothing
  runs until tomorrow. A decision that waits on the open or the 10:00 data goes
  in "For the post-open review" with its levels. Anything later is an order now:
  "if it holds X" is a resting limit at X, "if it breaks Y" a stop entry at Y. A
  plan that only lives in the prose never executes.
- **Respect the caps in the book state below.** They count resting entries as if
  filled. Plays are admitted highest conviction first and the rest are dropped,
  so the book state's room figures are what you have to work with.
- **Choose a risk tier, not a size.** Give entry, stop, target and `risk_pct`.
  Share count is derived from your stop and tier against live equity.
- **A stop or target change you only describe in prose does not happen.** Any
  adjustment to an open position or a resting entry — new stop, new target, an
  exit, or a cancel — must also appear in the `manage` array of the JSON block,
  including on a `no_trade` day. The stops shown in the book state below are the
  live resting orders.

Write the full prose brief as specified, then the JSON block. The prose is the
permanent record of your reasoning and is committed to a public repository, so
write it to be read months from now by someone checking whether your stated
reasoning matched what actually happened. That applies to what you pass on as
much as to what you trade.

Your probability estimates are scored against outcomes. Spread them according to
what you actually believe rather than clustering everything near 60% — a brief
where every play is 65% carries no information and will score no better than a
coin flip.
