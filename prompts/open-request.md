Produce the post-open review.

The cash session has been open for about 35 minutes. This morning's pre-market
brief is below, followed by the live book and market data, which now include
today's opening prices. This is the second and last decision point of the day:
after this review, nothing looks at the book until tomorrow's pre-market brief.

What this session is for:

- **Fills at the open.** Check every entry that filled since the morning. An
  entry that filled on a gap through its limit sits closer to its stop than
  planned: it risks less than it was sized for, which is not a reason to close
  it. Close it through `manage` only if what caused the gap is the invalidation
  you wrote this morning. Otherwise its bracket stands.
- **Open positions.** The same test as the morning: closed only on the recorded
  invalidation, its own binary event before tomorrow's brief, or its tenth
  session. No stop is tightened.
- **The morning's plans for this review.** The 08:30 and 10:00 ET data have
  printed and the opening range is set. For each thing the morning brief said it
  would decide after the open or after the data, decide now: act, or say why not.
- **Resting entries** the open has made stale: amend or cancel them.
- **New plays**, under the same rules as the morning, pass-2 research
  included. Orders now go into a trading market: a limit at or through the last
  price fills immediately, and a `market` entry is sized from the last price.

Do not re-trade the morning's reasoning without new information. Reversing a
morning call needs something that happened since it was written: a print, a
headline, or what the open did. Everything in the morning's rules still binds:
search before you write, verified prices only (the market data table counts),
prose alone moves nothing, risk tiers, caps. If the morning's plan stands
unchanged, say so in a few lines and emit the JSON with empty arrays.

Keep the review short:

### 1. Since the open
Two or three sentences: what printed, how the market opened, and what changed
versus the morning brief.

### 2. Fills, positions and resting entries
Each position: keep, or close and which of the three conditions applies. Each
resting entry: keep, amend or cancel, and why.

### 3. The morning's plans
Each plan the morning left for this review: acted on, not triggered, or dropped.
One line each.

### 4. New plays
The same table as the pre-market brief.

### 5. Passing on
One line each. Ideas with real levels also go in the `passed` array, where they
are scored.

### 6. For tomorrow
Any level or condition you would act on tomorrow. Tomorrow's pre-market brief is
shown this review. "None" is fine.

Then the JSON block, in the same schema as the morning.

Your probability estimates are scored against outcomes, on the bracket as you
submit it. Start from the base rate in "Your record" and move off it only for
reasons you name.
