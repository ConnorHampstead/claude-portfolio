Produce the post-open review.

The cash session has been open for about 35 minutes. This morning's pre-market
brief is below, followed by the live book and market data, which now include
today's opening prices. This is the second and last decision point of the day:
after this review, nothing looks at the book until tomorrow's pre-market brief.

What this session is for:

- **Fills at the open.** Check every entry that filled since the morning. An
  entry that filled on a gap through its limit sits closer to its stop than
  planned and may no longer be the trade you meant. Keep it, tighten it, or close
  it, through `manage`.
- **The morning's plans for this review.** The 08:30 and 10:00 ET data have
  printed and the opening range is set. For each thing the morning brief said it
  would decide after the open or after the data, decide now: act, or say why not.
- **Resting entries** the open has made stale: amend or cancel them.
- **New plays**, under the same rules as the morning. Orders now go into a
  trading market: a limit at or through the last price fills immediately, and a
  `market` entry is sized from the last price.

Do not re-trade the morning's reasoning without new information. Reversing a
morning call needs something that happened since it was written: a print, a
headline, or what the open did. Everything in the morning's rules still binds:
search before you write, verified prices only (the market data table counts),
prose alone moves nothing, risk tiers, caps. If the morning's plan stands
unchanged, say so in a few lines and emit the JSON with empty arrays.

Keep the review short:

### 1. Since the open
Two or three sentences: what printed, how the market opened, and what changed
versus the morning brief.

### 2. Fills, positions and resting entries
Each one: keep, tighten, amend, or close, and why.

### 3. The morning's plans
Each plan the morning left for this review: acted on, not triggered, or dropped.
One line each.

### 4. New plays
The same table as the pre-market brief.

### 5. Passing on
One line each. Ideas with real levels also go in the `passed` array, where they
are scored.

Then the JSON block, in the same schema as the morning.

Your probability estimates are scored against outcomes. Spread them according to
what you actually believe rather than clustering everything near 60%.
